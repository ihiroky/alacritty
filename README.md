## About this fork!

This fork originally introduced only the smooth cursor motion, but now also
offers a second patch (**seltools**).
If you are only interested in one thing, all patches are independent and could
be built individually from __patch/...__ branches.

Package in AUR (contains all available patches):
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/alacritty-smooth-cursor-git .

This branch contains the following patches:

### smooth-cursor

This patch introduces basic cursor animations to Alacritty in a rather simple
way.
It replaces the block cursor render by a rectangle with a changed blend mode and
triggers a surface re-render every frame when the window is visible.

#### Known issues

* This fork doesn't run well on Wayland (#3 if you want to tackle it). For now,
  build the application without Wayland support to make it use XWayland:
  `cargo run --features=x11 --no-default-features`.  I used to recommend
  unsetting `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` here: __don't do it please__. This will make
  __all__ applications you start from the terminal ignore your Wayland session.
* Currently redraws are dumb and update the window every frame even if nothing
  has changed. Expect a little GPU usage in idle (progress in #2).
* Block cursor may look really off due to blending hack that essentially just
  inverts the character color. It is recommended to replace it with "underline"
  (see config or GIF demo)

#### Configure

Add/change the following entries in your `alacritty.toml`:

```toml
[cursor]
# Set to false to disable completely
smooth_motion = true
# 0.0 = cursor is not moving, 1.0 = cursor moves instantly
smooth_motion_factor = 0.2
# 0.0 = broken, 1.0 = cursor shape is unaffected by movement
smooth_motion_spring = 0.5
# Limits how the cursor size may change
smooth_motion_max_stretch_x = 3.0
smooth_motion_max_stretch_y = 3.0
# Override "block" cursor if you don't like how it looks in this fork
# I prefer "underline"
block_replace_shape = "underline"
```

## About

Alacritty is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but
allows for extensive [configuration](#configuration). By integrating with other
applications, rather than reimplementing their functionality, it manages to
provide a flexible set of [features](./docs/features.md) with high performance.
The supported platforms currently consist of BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness; there are
a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
a daily driver.

Precompiled binaries are available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

## Installation

Alacritty can be installed by using various package managers on Linux, BSD,
macOS and Windows.

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Windows can also be downloaded from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases).

For everyone else, the detailed instructions to install Alacritty can be found
[here](INSTALL.md).

### Requirements

- At least OpenGL ES 2.0
- [Windows] ConPTY support (Windows 10 version 1809 or higher)

## Configuration

You can find the documentation for Alacritty's configuration in `man 5
alacritty`, or by looking at [the website] if you do not have the manpages
installed.

[the website]: https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html

Alacritty doesn't create the config file for you, but it looks for one in the
following locations:

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.toml`
3. `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`
4. `$HOME/.alacritty.toml`

On Windows, the config file will be looked for in:

* `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`

## FAQ

**_Is it really the fastest terminal emulator?_**

Benchmarking terminal emulators is complicated. Alacritty uses
[vtebench](https://github.com/alacritty/vtebench) to quantify terminal emulator
throughput and manages to consistently score better than the competition using
it. If you have found an example where this is not the case, please report a
bug.

Other aspects like latency or framerate and frame consistency are more difficult
to quantify. Some terminal emulators also intentionally slow down to save
resources, which might be preferred by some users.

If you have doubts about Alacritty's performance or usability, the best way to
quantify terminal emulators is always to test them with **your** specific
usecases.

**_Why isn't feature X implemented?_**

Alacritty has many great features, but not every feature from every other
terminal. This could be for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's just not a
good fit for Alacritty. This means you won't find things like tabs or splits
(which are best left to a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.
